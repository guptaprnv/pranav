# Licence-Plate-Detection
This project aims to utilize Machine Learning and Image Processing techniques to detect/extract license plates of vehicle given an image. 


## Modules:

* You would want to start with the module **LP_Detect_main.py**. Lets go one by one 
 
   ### [Data Preparation and Feature Extraction](https://github.com/Sardhendu/License-Plate-Detection/blob/master/Code/Bld_FeatureCrps.py): 
   * This module is aimed to extract features from a license plate/non license plate and store them in the disk (Training Features). 
   * Here, we manually create a small dataset by cropping out License plates from vehicle images and small set of random images (non-license plates).
   * Usual image processing techniques such as thresholding, standarization, erosion etc. are applied to the images.
   * We employ **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)** as a features extraction technique. In a nutshell, given an image (say 32x32x3) **HOG** would create a feature vector which can be consumed by a Machine Learning model. You could even experiment with simple features extraction technique such as **Edges 32x32 = 1024x1**, **Flattening the image (32x32x3) into 3072x1** and use these vectors as an input to Machine learning Models.
   
       #### Module
       * Gets license plates and non-license plate from respective directories, extract features and stores the feature vectors into the disk
            * [Sample License Plate data](https://github.com/Sardhendu/License-Plate-Detection/tree/master/DataSet/Data-Files/images_train/Licence-Plate)
            * [Sample Non-License plate data](https://github.com/Sardhendu/License-Plate-Detection/tree/master/DataSet/Data-Files/images_train/Not-Licence-Plate)
     
   ### [Train Model](https://github.com/Sardhendu/License-Plate-Detection/blob/master/Code/BldModel.py): 
   * From step 1 we already have our features, now all we have to do is send these features to a machine learning model to learn a reasonable boundary to separate License plates and Non-License plates.
   * In our case, the data is not very big, so we use **Support Vector Machines** as our machine learning model. SVM's with RBF kernel performs excellent with small data size and are robust to overfitting.
   
        ##### Module:
        * Fetches the saved features and the corresponding label (license_plate or non-license plate) and sends it to the SVM model.
        * Stores the learned model into the disk to be used while cross validation and testing. 
            * [CSV files containing the features](https://github.com/Sardhendu/License-Plate-Detection/tree/master/DataSet/Feature-Model)
             
   ### [Cross Validation](https://github.com/Sardhendu/License-Plate-Detection/blob/master/Code/LP_Detect_main.py):
   * Now that we have a model in place we would want to validate the model to predict if a rectangular region is license plate or non-license plate
   * **Note** here we do not provide the whole image, but use manually extract license plates and random images to get a sense of the model performance
   
   ### [Extract License plate](https://github.com/Sardhendu/License-Plate-Detection/blob/master/Code/LP_Detect_main.py):
   * We have every thing set up. We have a good model too and have validated it against cross validation dataset. Now the aim is to extract all the license plate given a image containing vehicles. 
   * We know that a license plate has visible edges. So, we extract all contours or region of interests **(ROI)** from a image, i.e (rectangles, circles polygon defined with intense edges).
   * We know that license plate are rectangular in shape, so we reshape/extend the **ROI** as rectangles. Note, for a given image we can have 100's or **ROI** of which only 2-3 would be license plate. So we have to classify all the **ROI** using our **SVM** model.   
   * All the **ROI's** are send to the feature extractor module.
  * The generated features for each **ROI** are then send to the **SVM** classifier for classification.
  * A high probability (say >90%) indicates a **ROI** to be the license plate. 
  * Finally we stash the **ROI** that have high probability of being a license plate into the disk for manual examination.
      
  **Look HERE** to get a sense of the directory name, so that you can run the model for yourself.
      
      
## Snapshot of the process

#### Train: 
Training data is manually created by taking a vehicle's image and cropping out the license plate image. Another 
simple way would be to extract all possible contours form the image (look at /Code/Classify.py) and save them in a 
directory. Then manually go an select the license plates. Below are some images of License plates used for Training.

##### License Plates:

##### Non License Plates

#### Test:
For testing, an image containing a vehicle image with its license plate was provided. Given the image we first 
extracted all the **ROI's** and then classify each **ROI's** as a license plate or not a license plate.

A sample of Dataset is provided: Look under the directory folder "/DataSet" to get a sense of the dataset.
